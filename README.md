This is the repository for LandScape Corridors (LSCorridors). It is a free and open source package 
that simulates multiple functional ecological corridors.

LSCorridors was developed and is maintained by the [Spatial Ecology and Conservation Lab](http://leec.eco.br) (LEEC), at Universidade Estadual Paulista, Rio Claro, SP, Brazil.
